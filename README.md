BRUNCH MADNESS GAME

HOW TO:

Object: Serve the customers as fast as possible.  Make 3 mistakes and you’re fired.

Use the *arrow keys* to move the waiter around the restaurant.

Run to 🤗 to take a new order. Run to the bar entrance to submit the order by entering the table number and drinks.  Don’t let the customers get too angry. 🤬 means you have 10 seconds left to complete an order or it’s a mistake!

When ✍️, 💵, or 💳 appear at a table, run to the register to either deliver the check or close out a table.  Don’t leave the customers waiting!

Score: $1 tip for every correct order plus 20% tips for every closed table.
